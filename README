# Blogerei

This is a blog written on Scala using [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.com), [Slick](http://slick.typesafe.com/) with Postgres DB,
[Specs2](http://etorreborre.github.io/specs2/), [Activator and SBT](https://www.typesafe.com/community/core-tools/activator-and-sbt#overview). This code is currently running on the http://blogerei.com domain. The main topic of the blog is to present my examples of Scala solutions to different puzzles and problems. More about me and the blog can be read on the [About page](http://blogerei.com/about)
